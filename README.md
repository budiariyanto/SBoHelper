SboHelper
=========

My scripts collection as helper to install package using SlackBuilds script. You can use it if you like to.
The goal is helping slackbuild installation easier and cleaning the extracted slackbuild package.

Usage:
variable.sh use to configure the version of the package.
Put variable.sh, SBoHelperScript, source package and SlackBuild scripts in together in a directory and execute SBoHelper for the respective package.

I only test my script on my machine (Slackware 14 x86_64)
This git repository doesn't include the source package and the slackbuild scripts.
To download the slackbuild scripts, you can visit http://slackbuilds.org
